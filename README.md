Insider is a **testing utility framework** which sets an HTTP client-sever communication channel between your app and testing environments like [Appium](http://appium.io/), [Calabash](http://calaba.sh/), [Frank](http://www.testingwithfrank.com/), etc. Some real use cases where Insider can be useful as part of the automation testing process:
* Set a particular state for the app during the test scenario;
* Simulate push notifications;
* Simulate app invocation using custom schemes / universal links;
* Simulate back-end responses;
* Manage files / directories in application sandbox;
* Collect metrics from the app during test execution (CPU, memory, etc.);
* etc.

Insider runs an HTTP server inside the application and listens for commands. By default Insider runs on `http://localhost:8080`. A command represents a simple HTTP request: `http://localhost:8080/<command>`

## Features

  | Built-in Features | Commands | HTTP Method
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
ðŸ’¡ | Invoke a method on a registered **delegate** with given parameters; | `/invoke` | POST
ðŸ“Ž | Invoke a method on a registered **delegate** with given parameters and wait for response; | `/invokeForResponse` | POST
ðŸ“¢ | Send local notifications through **NSNotificationCenter** with given parameters; | `/notification` | POST
ðŸ“± | Get device system state information (CPU, memory, IP address, etc); | `/systemInfo` | GET
:floppy_disk: |  Manage files / directories in application sandbox (Documents, Library, tmp); | `/documents/<command>`<br /> `/library/<command>`<br /> `/tmp/<command>` | See the table below

Supported commands for file managing feature:

 File Managing Commands | HTTP Method 
------------ | ------------- 
List items: `/<directory>/list` | GET
Download items: `/<directory>/download`  | GET
Upload items: `/<directory>/upload`  | POST
Move items: `/<directory>/move`  | POST
Delete items: `/<directory>/delete`  | POST
Create folder: `/<directory>/create`  | POST

In the `scripts` directory can be found some sample ruby scripts which show the built-in features in action.

## Installation

#### Manual installation

In order to include the **Insider** library into your project, you need to build a dynamic framework from provided source code and include it into your project; however you can get a prebuilt version of the framework from the [release page](https://github.com/alexmx/Insider/releases).

#### Carthage

If you are using **Carthage**, you can always use it to build the library within your workspace by adding the line below to your `Cartfile`.

```
github "alexmx/Insider"
```

## Usage

#### Use case #1: Simulate Push Notifications

```swift

import Insider

class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

  func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {

        Insider.sharedInstance.startWithDelegate(self)
        
        return true
  }
  
  func application(application: UIApplication, didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [NSObject : AnyObject]) {
        // Process push notification
  }
}

extension AppDelegate: InsiderDelegate {

  func insider(insider: Insider, invokeMethodWithParams params: JSONDictionary?) {
        // Simulate push notification
        self.application(UIApplication.sharedApplication(), didReceiveRemoteNotification: params!);
  }
}

```
In order to test this example run `InsiderUseCases` application target, after go to `scripts` directory and run `invoke_method.rb` script.

#### Use case #2: Simulate app invocation using a custom scheme

```swift

import Insider

class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

  func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {
        
        Insider.sharedInstance.startWithDelegate(self)
        
        return true
  }
  
  func application(application: UIApplication, handleOpenURL url: NSURL) -> Bool {
        // Process custom scheme invocation
        return true
    }
}

extension AppDelegate: InsiderDelegate {

  func insider(insider: Insider, invokeMethodForResponseWithParams params: JSONDictionary?) -> JSONDictionary? {
        // Simulate app invocation using a custom scheme
        let url = NSURL(string: "insiderDemo://hello/params")
        let response = application(UIApplication.sharedApplication(), handleOpenURL: url!)
        
        return ["response" : response]
    }
}

```
In order to test this example run `InsiderUseCases` application target, after go to `scripts` directory and run `invoke_method_with_response.rb` script.

#### Use case #3: Get application system information during test execution

```swift
import Insider

class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

  func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {
        
        Insider.sharedInstance.start()
        
        return true
  }
}
```
As it is a built-in feature there is no need to set a delegate for Insider in this case. In order to test this example run `InsiderDemo` application target, after go to `scripts` directory and run `system_info.rb` script.

#### Use case #4: Add files to Documents folder in application sandbox.

```swift
import Insider

class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

  func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {
        
        Insider.sharedInstance.start()
        
        return true
  }
}
```
As it is a built-in feature there is no need to set a delegate for Insider in this case. In order to test this example run `InsiderDemo` application target, and open [http://localhost:8080/documents](http://localhost:8080/documents) url in your browser.

![Insider](/assets/sandbox.png)

There are 3 directories supported in application sandbox:
* **Documents**: `http://localhost:8080/documents`
* **Library**: `http://localhost:8080/library`
* **tmp**: `http://localhost:8080/tmp`

You can create new folders. Upload, download, move, remove files / folders from application sandbox.
