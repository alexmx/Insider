Insider is a **testing utility framework** which makes an iOS app to be accessible through the HTTP interface. It runs a web server instance inside the app which receives commands from the external testing environment.

This utility framework can be used to establish a testing communication channel between the tested app and the testing environments like [Appium](http://appium.io/), [Calabash](http://calaba.sh/), [Frank](http://www.testingwithfrank.com/), etc.
